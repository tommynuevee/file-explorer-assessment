This is the File explorer solution for the technical test.

## Getting Started

Live version: https://file-explorer-assessment.vercel.app/
To run locally (node version 18 and above):

### Set up env variables

Check .env.example
If you want to use the API and know the secret, then set up the API_SECRET accordingly.
Otherwise you can set MOCK_REPONSE as true to use a fixed JSON response mock.

### Install dependencies and run dev server

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### API Routes

/api/directories
